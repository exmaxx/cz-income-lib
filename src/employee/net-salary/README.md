# Net Salary

The calculation of the net salary for an employee based on his gross salary, tax and insurance rates.

## Overview

The net salary formula:

$$netSalary = grossSalary - incomeTax - socialEmployeeAmount - healthEmployeeAmount$$

## Important Considerations

- **Income Tax High Rate**: Above certain salary level, the tax rate increases.
- **Social Insurance**: The social insurance is capped at a maximum base.
- **Health Insurance**: The health insurance contributions must meet a minimum amount. The employee must pay the difference if the amount is lower.

## Yearly vs. Monthly Salary

We use yearly-based calculation.
